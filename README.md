# Large Language Models

## What it is ?

I plan to make this repository a single window to all the activities I plan to do under the Large Language Models (LLM). In particular I plan to post here the following items. 

- Important papers leading to LLMs
- Open source data sets 
- Open source models
- Import projects 
- Jupyter notebooks.


## Why so much hype about LLMs ?

- First stop towards General Artificial Intelligence (GAI)

It has been claimed that LLMs take us very close to GAI - almost or superior than human intelligence !
It is true that langauge makes an important tool to our cognitive toolbox but verbal and textual language 
does not capture the full bandwidth of our communication channel. Apart from that, there is a lot of subjectivity,
variability and arbitrariness in the language we use in the communication.
